# How to edit
The main content can be found in the ``_data`` folder, in separate ``yaml`` files. Here, team members, research topics, courses, and thesis topics can be added/changed/removed. In ``assets/publications/publications.bib``, publications can be added as bib entries. New pages can be added as markdown files (see, for example, ``research/ct.md``), and images can be added to the ``assets/img`` folder.
